AIM:To study the characteristics and switching behavior of an NMOS transistor in a common-source configuration. The experiment involves analyzing how the transistor operates as a switch by varying the gate voltage (V₂) and observing the output voltage at the drain.

Components and Equipment Required:

    NMOS transistor (M1)
    Resistor (R1) = 1kΩ
    DC Power Supply (V1 = 1.8V)
    Variable DC Source (V2) for gate control
    Breadboard or circuit simulation software (e.g., LTspice, Multisim, Proteus)
    Multimeter or oscilloscope
    

PROCEDURE:

    Connect the drain of the NMOS transistor (M1) to the 1kΩ resistor (R1).
    Connect the other end of R1 to the V1 (1.8V DC power supply).
    Connect the source of M1 to ground.
    Connect the gate of M1 to a variable DC voltage source (V2).
    Set up a multimeter or oscilloscope to measure the drain voltage (V_D).
