THEORY:
Amplifiers are a basic part of analog circuit design, and MOSFETs serve as excellent amplification devices. Among the various amplifier configurations, the common-source (CS) amplifier is widely used. It is characterized by having the gate as the input, the drain as the output, and the source as the common terminal for AC signals.

In this configuration, a resistor acts as the load at the drain terminal.
Large-Signal Operation
The behavior of the circuit changes as the input voltage (VIN) varies:
When VIN is near zero, the MOSFET remains off, and the output voltage (VOUT) is at VDD.
As VIN approaches the threshold voltage (VTH), the MOSFET starts conducting, leading to a small voltage drop across the load resistor (RL), causing VOUT to decrease.
When VIN exceeds VTH, the MOSFET enters saturation, and the amplifier operates effectively.
As VIN continues to increase, the MOSFET eventually enters the linear region, causing a further drop in VOUT.
Since MOSFETs function best as amplifiers in saturation, the effective operating range of the amplifier is limited to values where the transistor remains in saturation.

CALCULATIONS:

Width (W = 50u)
RD = 1.833kΩ
Gain = 14.6dB
1. Differential Pair Operation
    M1 and M2 (NMOS transistors) form a differential amplifier with a common-source connection.
    The gates of M1 and M2 receive the same input voltage (1.3V), ensuring balanced operation.
    The common-source node (bottom connection of M1 and M2) is connected to a current source (R3), setting the total bias current.
2. Current Mirror Load
    R1 and R2 (1.833kΩ each) act as load resistors, converting drain currents into output voltages.
    Because both inputs (V2 and V3) are equal (1.3V), the circuit is symmetric, meaning M1 and M2 share equal current.
3. Bias Current Analysis
    The resistor R3 (0.4166kΩ) determines the total tail current, which splits equally between M1 and M2 under ideal conditions.
    The total tail current ItailItail​ is given by:
    Itail=VSSR3
    Itail​=R3​VSS​​ Given V_SS = 2.5V,
    Itail=2.5V0.4166kΩ≈6mA
    Itail​=0.4166kΩ2.5V​≈6mA Thus, each transistor ideally conducts:
    ID=Itail2=3mA
    ID​=2Itail​​=3mA
4. Output Voltage Behavior
    The drain voltages at M1 and M2 are determined by the current flowing through R1 and R2:
    Vout=VDD−(ID×RD)
    Vout​=VDD​−(ID​×RD​) Given I_D = 3mA and R1 = 1.833kΩ:
    Vout=2.5V−(3mA×1.833kΩ)=2.5V−5.5V
    Vout​=2.5V−(3mA×1.833kΩ)=2.5V−5.5V This indicates MOSFETs may not be in saturation, and adjustments to resistance values or supply voltage may be needed.
5. Circuit Applications
    This differential pair is used in amplifiers, comparators, and ADCs.
    It provides high gain and common-mode rejection.
    The circuit can be modified for differential gain analysis by applying a small differential input (V2 ≠ V3).
